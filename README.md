# Warehouse managment application
Made in java with Swing. Handles easly implementable products class with reflection and save them to csv file.<br>
[Example of minimal implementation of product class.](https://github.com/1mB33/WarehouseManagmentApp/blob/main/src/main/java/PojazdyOsobowe/Warehouse/Products/OnionDummyTestClass.java)<br>
Project files were generetad with maven. <br>
GUI can be easly translated to diffrent languages through implementation of json file. Filetring and sorting of the tables is implemented.
Application was tested on a database with 10000 entries and worked acceptably well, but on larger databases a performance bottleneck might be present as the application is single threaded.
Code should be relatively easy to bulid on. Comments are in polish, because project was done for a class assignment.
